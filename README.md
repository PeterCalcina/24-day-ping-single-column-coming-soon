## Development

- General styles were set as variables in the ```:root``` of the CSS.

- Basic HTML structure for the page was created, divided into two main sections: the ```main``` and ```footer```

- A ```<div>``` for the toast was created to display a message when the user subscribes.

- The necessary styles for the page were created in the CSS file, utilizing animations with ```@keyframes``` and implementing responsive design.

- A JavaScript file imported in the HTML was used to validate the proper functioning of the form, toast, and validation animations.
